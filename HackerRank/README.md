#### [Day 6: Let's Review](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-review-loop)

        Explanation: This is a simple problem. It asks to create 2 string one containing all the character at the even position and the other containing all the character at the odd position. 
      Just iterate through the string till the last character and keep finding the index mod 2 for each position. if the mod is 0 add the character at the position to the even string and if the mod is 1 add the character to the odd string. 
      Here index is the position of each character in the string. I have used substrings to to create the string in java code. There should be a similar way in all the other programming language.
     
#### [Day 10: Binary Numbers](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-binary-numbers)
##### [*Solution*](https://github.com/gauravprasad/CodingChallenge/blob/master/HackerRank/src/main/java/com/gprasad/hackerrank/tutorial/thirtydaysofcode/Day10BinaryNumbers.java)
        Explanation: Take two integer variable. One storing the max and the second one storing the count of consecutive 1's. Now the input in the problem is a decimal number (number with base 10). 
      Here we need to think first how to convert the decimal to binary. and then count 1's. But doing this in two step will increase the execution time. So we have to do it in one step. If we go back to the school days we can get the answer.
      Execute a while loop till the number is greater then zero.
