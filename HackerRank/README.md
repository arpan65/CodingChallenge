        __Explanation__ This is a simple problem. It asks to create 2 string one containing all the character at the even position and the other containing all the character at the odd position. 
      Just iterate through the string till the last character and keep finding the index mod 2 for each position. if the mod is 0 add the character at the position to the even string and if the mod is 1 add the character to the odd string. 
      Here index is the position of each character in the string. I have used substrings to to create the string in java code. There should be a similar way in all the other programming language.
